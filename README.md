All right, to add your stuff


Step 1) Make ur classes inside MODELS!

Step 2) go to the pages inside componets
then add a scaffold item, look for the ur class but make sure it includes model in there

Step 3) The scaffold item creates razor applications, with that ur able to pretty much implement the visual and below u add a code segment.

ex)

@code
public pizza(string party){
  public bool cheese;
}
